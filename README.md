# SDPNet
A Deep Network for Pan-sharpening with Enhanced Information Representation


## To test with the pretrained model:

## To train:
* Step 1: download the [h5 file]() or create your own h5 file according to [it](https://github.com/hanna-xu/utils).
* Step 2: run P2MS_main.py and MS2P_main.py for P2MS and MS2P models
* Step 3: run spec_main.py and spat_main.py for spatial and spectral encoders and unique channels
* Step 4: run main.py for pansharpening (2 GPUs are needed)
